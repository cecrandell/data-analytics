# Unions

## Instructions

1. Using `UNION`, write a PostgreSQL statement to query the number of rows in tables `city` and `country`.

```
SELECT
    COUNT(*)
FROM
    city
UNION
SELECT
    COUNT(*)
FROM
    country;
```

2. Use `UNION` to display from the tables `customer` and `customer_list` the ID of all customers who live in the city of London. Determine whether both tables contain the same customers by using `UNION ALL`.

```
SELECT
    customer_id
FROM
    customer
WHERE
    address_id IN (
        SELECT
            address_id
        FROM
            address
        WHERE
            city_id IN (
                SELECT
                    city_id
                FROM
                    city
                WHERE
                    city = 'London'
            )
    )
UNION
ALL
SELECT
    id
FROM
    customer_list
WHERE
    city = 'London';
```
