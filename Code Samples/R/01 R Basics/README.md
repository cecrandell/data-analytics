# We R in Junior High Again

## Instructions

- You are the homeroom teacher of a class of junior high students, and it is the first day of the school year. You will use R to automate some of the tasks, such as generating daily attendance sheets, and creating locker combinations.

### Part I

- Create a vector of the following students:

  - Abraham
  - Beatrice
  - Cory
