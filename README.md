# Data Analytics

## A Note from Caroline Crandell

"In 2019/2020, I was a remote coding bootcamp teaching assistant at the University of California, Berkeley. I primarily taught full-stack web development, however, I also received training for the data analytics bootcamp. Over the years since, I have worked as a report writer (implementing SQL queries into financial transaction reports), I have completed a masters in computer science at a top ten university, University College London (UCL), and I have worked as a full-stack software engineer at Podium, a SaaS company (Elixir, PostgreSQL, React). Following the recent layoffs in tech (2022/2023), I am reflecting a lot on what I want in my next role, keeping what worked in previous roles and leaving behind what didn't. Before pivoting into computer science, I worked in academic research at top ten university (Imperial College London), and this was one of my first professional experiences working with data (qualitative and quantitative). I still work in this role, remotely and infrequently these days, but I am keen to work full-time in a data analyst role, strengthening my skills in data analysis and gaining new experiences/learning new languages along the way. In this repository, I have included a few of my code solutions for a range of data analytics bootcamp activities, and below is a breakdown of what is included in this portfolio. Please feel free to reach out using my contact details below."
